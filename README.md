# Simple Java TodoList
This is just a trivial todo List for my personal use written in Java. Hope it could help someone else as well

I personally always make a to do list at the beginning of the day to get an overview of the things i have to handle
I dont like writting the to do list with notebook, because i also have some tasks that i need to do everyday to maintain my habit (Workout, readbook), so i create a save profile function that will enable you to save some tasks in a text file.

All you have to do is just open the customized profile user, it will load all the tasks you need during the day.
